# Epigenomic-Transcriptomic Integration for Bladder Cancer Prognosis

## Overview

This repository contains the analytical pipeline for identifying a prognostic gene signature in bladder cancer (BLCA) through integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis.

## Research Summary

Bladder cancer exhibits significant clinical heterogeneity, and existing classification systems offer limited prognostic value. This study integrates DNA methylation and gene expression data to develop a 25-gene risk signature that:

- Provides stage-independent prognostication
- Reveals distinct immune microenvironment profiles
- Identifies potential therapeutic targets in lipid metabolism

## Key Findings

- **25-gene signature** stratifies patients into high- and low-risk groups across multiple independent cohorts
- Signature enriched for **cell-cycle regulation** and **lipid metabolism** pathways
- Low-risk tumours show immune-inflamed phenotypes; high-risk tumours exhibit low immune engagement
- Functional validation identifies **FASN** and **SCD** as actionable therapeutic targets
